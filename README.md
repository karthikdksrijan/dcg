# Drupal Common SnippetsDrupal Contribution Guideline (DCG)

The Drupal Contribution Guideline (DCG) is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Drupal open-source content management system. These guidelines are intended for individuals or organizations with varying levels of Drupal expertise, from beginners to experts. The DCG provides a step-by-step approach to contributing to Drupal, including how to find issues to work on, what kind of issues to avoid, how to submit a patch, and how to review and test patches submitted by others. These guidelines also provide information on how to communicate with the Drupal community and how to get help if you need it. By following these guidelines, contributors can help make Drupal a better platform for everyone while also improving their own Drupal skills and knowledge.
